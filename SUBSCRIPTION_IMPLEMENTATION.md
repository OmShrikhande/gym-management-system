# Gym Management System - Subscription Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the subscription system implementation for the Gym Management System. The system allows gym owners to subscribe to different plans, receive notifications about subscription status, and restricts access to the dashboard when a subscription expires.

## Features Implemented

1. **Subscription Management**
   - Subscription plans (Basic, Premium, Enterprise)
   - Subscription creation and renewal
   - Subscription status tracking

2. **Payment Tracking**
   - Payment history
   - Transaction recording
   - Payment status (Paid, Pending, Overdue)

3. **Notification System**
   - In-app notifications for subscription events
   - Payment reminders (2 days before expiration)
   - Subscription expiration alerts

4. **Access Restriction**
   - Complete dashboard access restriction when subscription expires
   - Redirect to subscription payment page
   - Access to billing pages even when subscription is expired

## Backend Components

1. **Models**
   - `subscriptionModel.js`: Stores subscription data, payment history, and status
   - `notificationModel.js`: Manages user notifications for subscription events

2. **Controllers**
   - `subscriptionController.js`: Handles subscription CRUD operations
   - `notificationController.js`: Manages notification creation and status

3. **Routes**
   - `/api/subscriptions`: Subscription management endpoints
   - `/api/notifications`: Notification management endpoints

4. **Middleware**
   - `checkSubscription.js`: Verifies subscription status for protected routes

## Frontend Components

1. **Context**
   - Enhanced `AuthContext.jsx` with subscription status checking
   - Added subscription status helpers

2. **Components**
   - `SubscriptionRequired.jsx`: Shown when subscription has expired
   - `NotificationCenter.jsx`: Displays in-app notifications
   - Updated `ProtectedRoute.jsx` to check subscription status
   - Updated `DashboardHeader.jsx` to show subscription status

3. **Pages**
   - Enhanced `BillingPlans.jsx` with subscription management UI

## How It Works

1. **Subscription Lifecycle**
   - Gym owner subscribes to a plan
   - System tracks subscription status and expiration date
   - Notifications are sent 2 days before expiration
   - Upon expiration, access is restricted until renewal

2. **Access Control Flow**
   - User logs in
   - System checks if user is a gym owner
   - If yes, subscription status is verified
   - If subscription is active, normal access is granted
   - If subscription is expired, user is redirected to payment page

3. **Notification Flow**
   - System checks subscription status daily
   - Notifications are created for upcoming expirations
   - Notifications appear in the notification center
   - Users can click notifications to take action

## Testing

To test the subscription system:

1. Log in as a gym owner
2. Navigate to Billing Plans
3. Subscribe to a plan
4. To simulate expiration, you can manually update the subscription end date in the database
5. Once expired, verify that access is restricted and the payment page is shown

## Future Enhancements

1. Integration with real payment gateways
2. Subscription plan comparison
3. Automatic renewal options
4. Discount codes and promotions
5. Usage analytics and recommendations
