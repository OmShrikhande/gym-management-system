# Gym Branding Implementation

## Overview
This implementation fixes the issue where gym branding (theme, logo, app name) was only applied to gym owners but not to trainers and members of the same gym.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### New Files Created:
- **`src/hooks/useGymBranding.js`**: Custom hook for managing gym branding and app settings
- **`src/components/BrandingManager.jsx`**: Component for managing dynamic branding (favicon, page title)
- **`test-gym-branding.js`**: Test script for verifying branding functionality

#### Modified Files:

**`src/components/layout/DashboardHeader.jsx`**:
- Added dynamic app name and logo support
- Added gradient background colors based on gym settings
- Improved fallback logic for logo display

**`src/App.jsx`**:
- Added BrandingManager component to handle global branding

**`src/lib/settings.jsx`**:
- Updated `applySettings` function to handle gym-specific storage
- Updated `initializeSettings` to support gym branding for all user types
- Updated `getAppSettings` to handle different storage key formats

**`src/lib/settingsCache.js`**:
- Updated cache key generation for gym-specific settings

**`src/hooks/useRealTimeSettings.js`**:
- Updated to fetch gym settings for trainers and members

**`src/components/SettingsInitializer.jsx`**:
- Updated to fetch gym settings for trainers and members instead of user-specific settings

### 2. Backend Changes

**`server/models/Setting.js`**:
- Added `appSubtitle` field to global settings
- Added additional branding fields: `backgroundColor`, `cardColor`, `sidebarColor`, `textColor`, `darkMode`

**`server/controllers/settingController.js`**:
- Updated `getGymSettings` to allow trainers and members to access their gym's settings
- Updated `getUserSettings` to return gym settings for trainers and members

## How It Works

### For Gym Owners:
1. Gym owners create/update their gym settings
2. Settings are stored with their user ID as the gym ID
3. Their branding is applied immediately

### For Trainers and Members:
1. When trainers/members log in, they fetch their gym's settings (using their `gymId`)
2. The system looks up settings using the gym owner's ID
3. Branding is applied using the gym owner's settings
4. Settings are cached locally for offline access

### Settings Priority:
1. **Gym Owners**: Their own gym settings
2. **Trainers/Members**: Their gym's settings (gym owner's settings)
3. **Super Admins**: Global settings
4. **Fallback**: Default settings

## Storage Structure

### localStorage Keys:
- `gym_settings_user_{userId}` - User-specific settings
- `gym_settings_gym_{gymId}` - Gym-specific settings
- `gym_settings` - Global settings
- `gym_branding_{gymId}` - Cached branding settings

### API Endpoints:
- `/settings` - Global settings (super admin)
- `/settings/gym/{gymId}` - Gym-specific settings
- `/settings/user/{userId}` - User-specific settings

## Features Implemented

1. **Dynamic App Name**: Changes based on gym settings
2. **Dynamic Logo**: Shows gym logo if available, falls back to default icon
3. **Dynamic Favicon**: Updates page favicon based on gym settings
4. **Dynamic Page Title**: Updates browser title based on gym settings
5. **Theme Colors**: Applies gym-specific primary and secondary colors
6. **Real-time Updates**: Settings sync across all users of the same gym
7. **Caching**: Efficient caching to reduce API calls
8. **Fallback Logic**: Graceful fallbacks when settings are unavailable

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Log in as a gym owner
2. Go to Settings and update branding (app name, logo, colors)
3. Log in as a trainer or member of the same gym
4. Verify that the branding is applied correctly

Use the test script in browser console:
```javascript
testGymBranding()
```

## Production Considerations

1. **Error Handling**: All functions have proper error handling and fallbacks
2. **Performance**: Caching reduces API calls
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
4. **Offline Support**: localStorage fallbacks for offline access
5. **Security**: Proper authorization checks for accessing gym settings

## Deployment Notes

1. No database migrations required - new fields have defaults
2. Backward compatible with existing settings
3. All changes are additive, no breaking changes
4. Test thoroughly in staging environment before production deployment
