# Firestore to Realtime Database Sync Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds automatic synchronization from Firestore to Firebase Realtime Database for all attendance-related data. The system follows best practices by:
1. **First writing to Firestore** (primary database)
2. **Then syncing to Realtime Database** (secondary/backup)
3. **Non-blocking sync** - Realtime DB failures don't affect main operations
4. **Preserving all existing logic** - No deletions, only additions

## Data Structure Synchronization

### 1. Main Gym Document
**Firestore Path:** `gym/{gymOwnerId}`
**Realtime DB Path:** `gym/{gymOwnerId}`

**Synchronized Fields:**
- `status`: Door status (true = open, false = closed)
- `lastActiveMemberId`: ID of the last active member
- `lastActiveMemberName`: Name of the last active member

- `lastInactiveTimestamp`: Timestamp of member deactivation

### 2. Members Subcollection
**Firestore Path:** `gym/{gymOwnerId}/members/{memberId}`
**Realtime DB Path:** `gym/{gymOwnerId}/members/{memberId}`

**Synchronized Fields:**

- `gymOwner`: Gym owner's name
- `lastQRScan`: Timestamp of last QR scan
- `lastAccessGranted`: Timestamp when access was last granted
- `isActive`: Boolean indicating if member is currently active
- `createdAt`: Document creation timestamp (only for new records)
- `updatedAt`: Document update timestamp
- `deactivationReason`: Reason for deactivation (inactive members only)
- `deactivatedAt`: Timestamp of deactivation (inactive members only)

### 3. Scan Logs Subcollection
**Firestore Path:** `gym/{gymOwnerId}/scan_logs/{memberId}_{timestamp}`
**Realtime DB Path:** `gym/{gymOwnerId}/scan_logs/{auto-generated-key}`

**Synchronized Fields:**
- `memberId`: Member's MongoDB ID
- `status`: 'success' or 'failed'
- `reason`: Reason for the scan result
- `timestamp`: Server timestamp of the scan attempt
- `createdAt`: Log creation timestamp

### 4. Staff Subcollection
**Firestore Path:** `gym/{gymOwnerId}/staff/{staffId}`
**Realtime DB Path:** `gym/{gymOwnerId}/staff/{staffId}`

**Synchronized Fields:**
- `staffId`: Staff's MongoDB ID
- `staffName`: Staff member's name
- `staffEmail`: Staff member's email
- `staffRole`: 'trainer' or 'gym-owner'
- `entryStatus`: 'Active'
- `gymName`: Name of the gym
- `lastEntry`: Timestamp of last entry
- `lastAccessGranted`: Timestamp when access was last granted
- `isActive`: Boolean indicating if staff is currently active
- `status`: Boolean status (true for active)
- `createdAt`: Document creation timestamp (only for new records)
- `updatedAt`: Document update timestamp

## Modified Files

### 1. `/src/config/firebase.js`
**Changes:**
- Added Firestore import: `import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore'`
- Initialized Firestore: `const db = getFirestore(app)`
- Exported both databases: `export { database, db }`

### 2. `/src/services/firestoreService.js`
**Changes:**
- Added Realtime Database imports
- Modified `updateMemberStatusToActive()` - Added Realtime DB sync
- Modified `logQRScanAttempt()` - Added Realtime DB sync
- Modified `updateDoorStatus()` - Added Realtime DB sync
- Modified `updateStaffEntryStatus()` - Added Realtime DB sync
- Modified `updateMemberStatusToInactive()` - Added Realtime DB sync

### 3. `/src/controllers/memberController.js`
**Changes:**
- Added import: `import firestoreService from '../services/firestoreService.js'`

## Synchronized Methods

### 1. `updateMemberStatusToActive(memberId, gymOwnerId, memberData, gymData)`
- ‚úÖ Writes to Firestore first
- ‚úÖ Syncs to Realtime DB with same structure
- ‚úÖ Handles both new and existing members
- ‚úÖ Updates main gym document in both databases

### 2. `logQRScanAttempt(memberId, gymOwnerId, status, reason)`
- ‚úÖ Writes to Firestore first
- ‚úÖ Syncs to Realtime DB with same data
- ‚úÖ Updates main gym document with latest scan info

### 3. `updateDoorStatus(gymOwnerId, status)`
- ‚úÖ Writes to Firestore first
- ‚úÖ Syncs door status to Realtime DB
- ‚úÖ Updates timestamps in both databases

### 4. `updateStaffEntryStatus(staffId, gymOwnerId, staffData, staffRole)`
- ‚úÖ Writes to Firestore first
- ‚úÖ Syncs staff data to Realtime DB
- ‚úÖ Updates main gym document with staff info

### 5. `updateMemberStatusToInactive(memberId, gymOwnerId, reason)`
- ‚úÖ Writes to Firestore first
- ‚úÖ Syncs inactive status to Realtime DB
- ‚úÖ Handles both existing and new inactive records

## Error Handling
- **Non-blocking sync**: Realtime DB sync failures don't affect main operations
- **Comprehensive logging**: All sync operations are logged with success/failure status
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues to work even if Realtime DB is unavailable
- **Error isolation**: Each sync operation is wrapped in try-catch blocks

## Testing
A test script has been created at `/test-firestore-sync.js` to verify the implementation:
- Tests all synchronized methods
- Verifies data structure creation in both databases
- Provides comprehensive logging of operations

## Usage
The sync happens automatically whenever any of the modified methods are called. No additional code changes are required in controllers or other parts of the application.

## Benefits
1. **Data Redundancy**: Same data available in both Firestore and Realtime DB
2. **Real-time Updates**: Realtime DB provides instant updates for IoT devices
3. **Backup Strategy**: If one database fails, data is still available in the other
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
5. **Performance**: Non-blocking sync doesn't impact response times

## Monitoring
All sync operations include detailed console logging:
- ‚úÖ Success messages with operation details
- ‚ùå Error messages with failure reasons
- üìã Data structure information
- üö™ Door status updates
- üë• Member and staff activity logs
